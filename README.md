## Introduction

All pages have implemented a navigation bar using `display:flex` for the placement of elements on each page. CSS is used to implement hover effects for all links and buttons, providing a visual indication when the user hovers over them.

## Pages

- ### index.html
  The homepage of the website, featuring a welcome message and an image.

- ### announcement.html
  Displays course announcements, including date, topic, and announcement content.

- ### communication.html
  Users can communicate with the instructor in two ways: through a web form and via an email service (Gmail), with a corresponding link.

- ### documents.html
  Users can download files provided by the instructor. A placeholder "dummy" file is included in this example. Future files uploaded by the instructor will replace these placeholders.

- ### homework.html
  Lists all posted assignments along with their due dates.


## Styling

CSS is used to create a responsive and visually appealing design for the website.

## Usage

Clone this repository and open the HTML files in a web browser to navigate through the course website.
